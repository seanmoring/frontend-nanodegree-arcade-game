frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

USING THE GAME:

1. After having cloned the repository on your machine, navigate to the directory /frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game and double click on the index.html file, which will cause the game to be loaded on the browser.

2. Once the game is loaded, use the arrow keys to move the player (represented by an avatar that looks like a boy) around the board. By moving to the squares with gems, you pick up those gems. Be careful to avoid getting hit by the bugs moving across the screen left to right. If you hit one, then the game will reset. 


EXTERNAL SOURCES

1. Used the following external source for how to do the class call for methods other than the constructor, because I wanted to call the superclass' function to reuse code while only wiring the new behaviour code in the subclasses. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8031467/override-a-base-class-function
